In Bag 18, we assemble the **roof** of our G-Class model. Known for its strength, the G-Class roof can support up to **150 kg** (330 lbs), making it ideal for roof racks, gear, or tents. Since 2019, Mercedes has used high-strength steel and **laser-welded joints**, enhancing both durability and stability while also reducing weight. This construction ensures that the roof can withstand off-road conditions and adds to the G-Class�s rugged reputation.
The G-Class�s boxy roof design not only maximizes interior space but also reflects its military origins. Reinforced with ultra-high-strength steel, the roof has been further adapted for armoring in some variants, meeting the needs of high-security or expedition applications. This combination of utility and strength has helped the G-Class stand the test of time, becoming one of the most iconic off-road vehicles.

[Section Title] Instructions 790-800: Completing Tailgate and Rearview Mirror

[Main Text] 
In this final stage, we complete the **tailgate assembly** and add the **rearview mirror**. The origins of the G-Class trace back to a proposal from the **Shah of Iran** in the early 1970s. A major shareholder in Mercedes-Benz, the Shah suggested creating a durable, off-road military vehicle, which led to the development of the G-Class. 
The G-Class was initially marketed under the **Puch brand** in Austria and some Eastern European countries due to the collaboration with Steyr-Daimler-Puch. This durable, versatile vehicle was officially launched in 1979 and quickly gained popularity across global markets, transforming from a military icon into a luxury off-road vehicle.
